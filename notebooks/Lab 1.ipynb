    "- Create a user-defined class `Real` that contains a private data member that would contain a value of the real number (10 pts).\n",

    "    - Overload the equality operation ( `==` ) to compare two  `Real`s.\n",

    "    - Overload the multiplication operator ( `*` ) to multiply two `Complex` numbers.\n",
    "    - Overload the equality operation ( `==` ) to compare two  `Complex` numbers.\n",
    "- Derive a class `Binomial` from `Complex` and add additional data member for the the exponents of algebraic coefficients (10 pts).\n",
    "    - Overload the addition operator ( `+` ) to add two `Binomial`s.\n",
    "    - Overload the equality operation ( `==` ) to compare two `Binomial`s.   \n",
    "- For every class the stream insertion `<<` operator functions as **friend** functions (10 pts). \n",
    "    - The stream insertion operator should not be able to display if an input error occurred.\n",
    "    - For negative imaginary values, a minus sign should be printed rather than a plus sign.    \n",
    "- For every class the stream extraction `>>` operator function should determine whether the data entered is valid, and, if not, it should set fail to indicate improper input (10 pts).\n",
    "    - The values can be negative or positive, and itâ€™s possible that one of the two values is not provided, in which case the appropriate data member should be set to 0."
